# A-Star-Path-Finding-Algorithm
About A Fast And Intelligent Path Finding Algorithm, A*. A* is a weighted algorithm and so that is reason why it completes very long and complex runs in a very-very short period of time. this project is 100% made of pure math logic and pure python.

### About
A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm. It allows you to pick your start and end location and view the process of finding the shortest path.

### Requirements
Python 3.x</br>
TKinter</br>
Pygame</br>

### How Do I Run This Type Of File (*.py) ?
**The Answer is simple in you command line (CMD Or Terminal Respectivly) type this command (Assuming You Have Python Installed In Your Computer):**</br>
`Z:SOME-PATH> python Astar.py`
